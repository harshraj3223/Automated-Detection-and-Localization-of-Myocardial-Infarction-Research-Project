# Automated-Detection-and-Localization-of-Myocardial-Infarction-Research-Project


For this project, I have built an architecture with One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Network (biLSTM) layers for automated detection and localization of MI ailment by extracting thirty-six morphological features from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) beats (amplitude of T-wave, the amplitude of Q-wave, and ST-segment deviation for all leads).

###THE OVERALL FINAL ACCURACY OBTAINED = 95.33% ####
