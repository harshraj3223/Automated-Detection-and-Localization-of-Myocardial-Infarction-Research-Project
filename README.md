# Automated-Detection-and-Localization-of-Myocardial-Infarction-Research-Project


In this project, I have built a deep architecture with One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory Network (biLSTM) layers for automated detection and localization of MI ailment by extracting thirty-six morphological and time-domain features from 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) beats (amplitude of T-wave, the amplitude of Q-wave, and ST-segment deviation for all leads).

***" THE OVERALL FINAL ACCURACY OBTAINED = 95.33% "***

Refer to the [Final Research Report](https://github.com/harshraj3223/Automated-Detection-and-Localization-of-Myocardial-Infarction-Research-Project/tree/main/Final%20Research%20Report), where I have written in detail about everything I did in/for this project during my research period. The accuracy analysis on each class has been explained there, too!!
