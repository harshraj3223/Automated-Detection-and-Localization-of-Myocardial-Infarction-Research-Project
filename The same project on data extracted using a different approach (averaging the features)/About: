So, I did the same project with data extracted (from the ptbxl database) using a different approach too! This new data with the same previous model (with only 50 epochs this time) 
gives an accuracy of 95.72%. Through this new approach, a single ECG record provides a maximum of only one data instance (or example). Here, we took averages of ST deviations, 
Q peaks, and T peaks for all the beats of a lead, and the same was done for all the 12 leads of a record. So, we again get a 36-dimensional feature vector as an instance 
from one ECG record; only this time, the data is different.
